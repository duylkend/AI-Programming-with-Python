4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: All three model architectures performed well, but the VGG model architecture stands out as it classified the dog in Dog_01.jpg as a poodle rather than a miniature poodle, which is closer to the actual breed, a golden doodle. This slight distinction makes the VGG model slightly more accurate in this particular case.
